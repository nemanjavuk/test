Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures set forth herein (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Seven Bridges prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from these Terms of Use, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms of Use not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to the Website, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Seven Bridges prior to the effective date of removal.
